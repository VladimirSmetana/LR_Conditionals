<h1>Topic 1 Conditionals in English</h1>
<p>What are conditionals in English grammar? Sometimes we call <br />
   them 'if clauses'. They describe the result of something that <br />
   might happen (in the present or future) or might have happened <br />
   but didn't (in the past) . They are made using different <br />
   English verb tenses.
